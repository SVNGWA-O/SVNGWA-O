I’m a lifelong learner who loves exploring new technologies and staying curious—whether it’s diving into the latest AI trends or mastering cloud services.

I believe that the best projects are built through collaboration, open communication, and a growth mindset.

Outside of coding, I enjoy listening to audiobooks, which keeps me inspired and always learning, even on the go.

Always happy to help others—whether it’s code reviews, troubleshooting, or just chatting about tech.
